## Front-End Challenge:

Piter (Marketing guy) asked you to implement a cryptocurrency live pricing application, he needs two core features:

1. List of cryptos sorted by price
2. A search widget to search on the list of cryptos (searching BTC returns all cryptos with BTC inside their name, like BTCUSDT, BTCETH, ...)

Please use technology of your choice:

- If you are a web developer you can use: ReactJS/AngularJS/VueJS
- And for mobile you can use Android/iOS/Flutter/ReactNative

## Back-End Challenge:

We need to provide a RESTful API for front-ends to:

- Get bitcoin-usd rate periodically (based on the config) then show the rate in the response of "rates" endpoint.
- Return the rate history of specified coin "bitcoin-usd", It also needs to have "startTime", "endTime" as two filtered params.

- The project should work and deliver the core features and we also consider clean code
- Please provide a good documentation
- We appreciate TDD
